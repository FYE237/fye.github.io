            <p>Since my childhood, I've always been interested in  digital tools, tools related to Technologies of Information and Communications. It was my dad who introduced the TICs system. He asked me to help him to make the balance sheets of the expenses of the house for the month, to help him to write the reports of the family meetings using Office Suite(Excel, Word).This interest has never left me. Therefore I decided that I want to be a computer engineer. During my classes , we were given software engineering classes. This led us to develop many products for academic purposes.For me i felt like i was a mini Mark Zuckerberg being able to go from nothing and develop applications that will be used by people like i was using Excel in my childhood with my father. It was such an exciting period.</p>
            <p>My interest in software engineering hasn’t been restricted to my school courses. Therefore I was always competing on coding platforms with many people around the world in order to consistently renew my skills, being able to judge my level at the world scale. I remember one time I took part in a coding competition organized by Google. I was very confident in my skills at that moment but the results weren’t great at all. I wasn’t even able to pass the qualification rounds. That was such a failure for me. It also helps to understand that there was still a long way to go :) :). At that moment one of my classmates recommended specific books to me that help to prepare for these coding competitions. This book helped me a lot. It showed me a totally new point of view on how to prepare for your career in software engineering , how to practice coding competition code, and how to prepare yourself for a job interview in this field of IT jobs. How to organize your work rate in order to get the best result possible , how a team of software engineers should cooperate. Six months later, there was a project competition organized in my school , with 5 of my friends we participated as a team. During our preparations, I insisted that my team follow the recommendations that  I learnt from the various books that I learnt. As time goes by, the other team member were really excited by the work we were doing, how we were working, they all admitted that this was such an efficient way of working.We were ready 2 weeks before the submissions deadline.  At the end of the competitions, we were awarded the first prize. This was so thrilling for me and my friends.</p>
